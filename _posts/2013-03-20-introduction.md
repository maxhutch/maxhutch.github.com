This blog is intended to be a home for short notes and data that are not well suited for more conventional publication.  I am not sure how it will evolve from here, seeing as I only have one post immediately in mind.  

### Reuse and citation
Consider the content public domain.  If you decide to extend any of my efforts, please cite the relevant blog entries {% cite Fenner2011 %} and [get in touch](mailto:maxhutch@gmail.com).

    @misc{
      author = {Hutchinson, Maxwell},
      title = {POST_TITLE},
      journal = {The Blog of Unfinished Tales},
      type = {Blog},
      number = {MONTH DD},
      year = {YYYY},
      howpublished = {\url{PERM_LINK}}
